# Changelog

## [0.2.52] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- **Track `trust-tasks-rs` 0.11.0**, up from 0.9.0. Both releases in between are
  additive — new task families, no change to any type this crate uses — so
  nothing here had to move but the requirement:

  - **0.10.0** added the `vta/contexts/*` and `vta/webvh/*` families (the
    did:webvh lifecycle: DIDs, hosting servers, agent names) and the eight
    `vta/services/*` families that supersede a VTA's `/services/*` REST routes.
  - **0.11.0** corrected two of those `vta/services/*` schemas after writing the
    handlers found them unable to express the operation: rollback can
    legitimately publish no log entry, and disable takes a drain window the
    agent may refuse to honour.

  The reason to take it here is that a VTA cannot: `vta-sdk` must speak the same
  `trust-tasks-rs` these crates do, because `acl_setup` builds a `MediatorAcl`
  and hands it to `TrustTasks::account_update`. Two semver-incompatible copies
  make that a type error, so the VTA stays on 0.9 until this workspace moves.
