# Changelog

## [0.16.5] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- `ATM::list_messages` and `ATM::delete_messages_direct` now apply a 15-second per-request HTTP timeout. Previously the calls were unbounded and would block for the OS-level TCP RTO (~30–60s on macOS) when the mediator was unreachable, contributing to slow shutdowns in downstream consumers that wrap them in their own connect path.

## [0.16.3] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- Add exponential backoff (1s-60s cap) on WebSocket reconnection after server-initiated disconnects. Previously, server-initiated Close frames (including mediator `duplicate-channel` rejections), protocol resets, and connection errors triggered immediate reconnection with zero delay, causing an infinite reconnect loop between two profiles sharing the same DID.
- Missed pong timeout now immediately drops the WebSocket and applies backoff, instead of leaving a half-closed connection.

## [0.16.2] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- Handle inbound WebSocket Ping frames from the mediator by responding with a Pong, instead of logging them as unknown message types.
