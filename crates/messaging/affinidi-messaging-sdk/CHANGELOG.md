# Changelog

## [0.17.0] - 2026-05-02

### Breaking

- Migrated to `affinidi-tdk-common` 0.6. The change is mechanical only —
  `TDKSharedState` field accesses (`tdk_common.client`, `.did_resolver`,
  `.secrets_resolver`, `.authentication`, `.environment`) replaced with
  the corresponding accessor methods on every code path. No behavioural
  changes within the SDK itself.
- `ATMProfile::to_tdk_profile` now constructs the `TDKProfile` via
  `TDKProfile::new(...)` instead of a struct literal — the `secrets`
  field is `pub(crate)` in tdk-common 0.6 and only constructible through
  the public API.

### Tests

- `unpack` test helpers (`create_atm_with_secrets`, `create_atm`,
  `create_atm_no_unpack_forwards`) updated to build a `TDKSharedState`
  via `TDKConfig::builder().with_load_environment(false)
  .with_use_atm(false).build()?` + `TDKSharedState::new`, replacing the
  removed `TDKSharedState::default().await`.

## [0.16.3] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- Add exponential backoff (1s-60s cap) on WebSocket reconnection after server-initiated disconnects. Previously, server-initiated Close frames (including mediator `duplicate-channel` rejections), protocol resets, and connection errors triggered immediate reconnection with zero delay, causing an infinite reconnect loop between two profiles sharing the same DID.
- Missed pong timeout now immediately drops the WebSocket and applies backoff, instead of leaving a half-closed connection.

## [0.16.2] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- Handle inbound WebSocket Ping frames from the mediator by responding with a Pong, instead of logging them as unknown message types.
