//! DID resolution - work in progress
//!
//! This module will contain the DID::resolve() and DIDMethod::resolve() implementations
//! that return a DID Document for locally-resolvable methods (key, peer).
//!
//! For network-resolvable methods (web, cheqd, etc.), use the Resolver trait.

// TODO: Implement resolution logic for did:key, did:peer, etc.
// The current implementation is incomplete and will be added in a future commit.
